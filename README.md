A (highly depressing) React-based visualisation app (unless you’re under the age of 18?) Displays the number of weeks in a 90 year human life, along with the number of weeks lived by the user based on their birthdate.

Based on [WaitButWhy‘s graphs](https://twitter.com/waitbutwhy/status/863083531207102465) of the number of weeks/days in a 90 year human life.
